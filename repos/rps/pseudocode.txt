pseudocode for rock paper scissors
----

logic for computer choice:

create a function called getComputerChoice
getComputerChoice
-   randomly return one of 
    the following string values:
    - "rock", "paper", "scissors"
-   initialize variable
-   set variable equal to random number generator between 1-3 
- if variable 1 = rock if 2 = paper if 3 = scissors  

----

logic for human choice:

create a function called getHumanChoice
prompt user to type the following string values:
    - "rock", "paper", "scissors"

we will NOT be handling invalid input in this assignment.

ensure human choice parameter is case insensitive
- rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK” will just be Rock and something similar for 
    paper and scissors 
    - capitalize first letter of each word and lowercase the rest
    - concatenate lowercase to first capitalized letter 


--------

keep score of the game:

create 2 variables humanScore and computerScore
initialize variables to 0

-------

logic for a single round:

create a function called playRound
create two parameters: humanChoice and computerChoice
use these parameters to take human and computer choices as arguments
console log the string value representing round winner like
"You lose! Paper beats rock"
logic for win/loss (rock beats scissors)
increment win / loss 

-----

logic for entire game:
create a function called playGame this function just 
throws playRound into a for loop 5 times and 
says who the winner is and what the score is
